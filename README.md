# FreeLancer BlackHoleOS

 Welcome to the FreeLancer BlackHoleOS repository. This is a free software project aiming to build a written-from-scratch, high-performance, multiserver, microkernel-based operating system, with emphasis in high-reliability. This repository is a macro-repository, containing subprojects that form part as a whole in the operating system. The only project that is presented apart is the FreeLancer MEL Microkernel.
 
 ## What is included into this repository?
 
  This repository includes:
  1. The GCC compiler patched for the BlackHoleOS system (IA32 and AMD64 architectures only, yet).
  2. An implementation of the C standard library
  3. Configuration scripts for building GCC and binutils.
